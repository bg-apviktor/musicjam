    "description": "Think warm summer evenings with guitars on a lawn, berry-coloured light filtering through trees. The palette is rooted in deep raspberry — rich and bold like jam itself — offset by clean whites and pops of leafy green. The overall feel is handmade yet polished: splatter textures, rounded shapes, and generous whitespace keep it youthful without being childish. Photography (when used) should show real teenagers making music together — candid, not posed."
